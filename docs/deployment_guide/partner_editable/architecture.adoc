image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture-diagram-sudo-serverless-wordpress.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* (Optional) An Amazon Route 53 record entry if you enter a hosted zone ID during Quick Start deployment.
* AWS WAF for managing rules to protect against SQL injection attacks and common WordPress exploits.
* In the public subnets:
** Elastic IP addresses for outbound traffic for AWS Fargate tasks.*
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** AWS Fargate tasks in an Auto Scaling group to launch and manage WordPress containers.
* An Application Load Balancer to manage traffic to AWS Fargate in the private subnets.
* Amazon ECS to deploy the WordPress container image to AWS Fargate.
* (Optional) AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for a public certificate for HTTPS connection.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store the RDS Aurora database password.
* Amazon Aurora serverless database connected to containers on AWS Fargate.
* An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storing WordPress files, themes, and plugins.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
