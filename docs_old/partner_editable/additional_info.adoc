The AWS Cloud provides a scalable, highly reliable platform that helps customers deploy applications and data quickly and securely. When you build systems on the AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This shared model can reduce your operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. In turn, you assume responsibility and management of the guest operating system, other associated applications, as well as the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall. 

{partner-product-name} includes these security features:

* https://aws.amazon.com/waf/[AWS WAF] to prevent SQL injection and common WordPress exploits.
* Port-hardened security groups and unnecessary ports closed by default.
* Periodic database backups.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
