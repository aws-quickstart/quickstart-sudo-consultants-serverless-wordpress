image::../images/architecture-diagram-sudo-serverless-wordpress.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An optional Amazon Route 53 record entry, if you enter a hosted zone ID during Partner Solution deployment.
* An AWS Web Application Firewall using AWS WAF managed rules to protect against SQL injection attacks and common WordPress exploits.
* In the public subnets:
** Elastic IP addresses for outbound traffic for AWS Fargate tasks.*
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** AWS Fargate, in an Auto Scaling group, to launch and manage WordPress containers.
** An Application Load Balancer to manage traffic to AWS Fargate in the private subnets.
* Amazon ECS to provision WordPress containers run on AWS Fargate.
* Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for an optional public certificate for HTTPS connection.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store the RDS Aurora database password.
* Amazon Aurora serverless database connected to containers on AWS Fargate.
* An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system for storing WordPress files, themes, and plugins.
