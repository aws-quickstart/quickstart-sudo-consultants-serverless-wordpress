=== Launch the Partner Solution
// Adapt the following warning to your Partner Solution.

WARNING: When deploying this Partner Solution into an existing VPC, ensure that your VPC has two private subnets in different Availability Zones for the workload instances and that the subnets are not shared. This Partner Solution does not support https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-sharing.html[shared subnets^]. These subnets require https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html[NAT gateways^] in their route tables to allow the instances to download packages and software without exposing them to the internet. Also ensure that the domain name option is configured as explained in http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html[DHCP options sets^]. You provide your VPC settings when you launch the Partner Solution.

Each deployment takes about {deployment_time} to complete.

. Sign in to your AWS account, and choose one of the following options to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. For help with choosing an option, see link:#_deployment_options[Deployment options] earlier in this guide.
